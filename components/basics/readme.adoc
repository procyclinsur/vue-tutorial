== Organizing Components

Components can be organized and further contain other components.  Before this can be realized, a component registry must be created.

There are two types of component registries, `global` and `local`.

Components are registered globally by using

[source, js]
----
Vue.component('my-component-name', {
  // ... options ...
})
----
