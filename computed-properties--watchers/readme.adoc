= Computed Properties

We have understood the process of bringing in variables from our Vue instance from its internal `data` object into our HTML temlate.

This can get unwieldy when you need to perform computations on these variables, and perhaps use these computations multiple times.  This is where Computed Properties come into play.

Like `data`, `computed` is another object found within the Vue instance.  It consists of variables, each with a function that returns some computed value.

.index.html
[source, html]
----
include::index.html[]
----

In the above file, instead of performing the JavaScript to reverse the message within the template block, we have created a new `reversedMessage` variable within our Vue instance to perform the processing.

.index.js
[source, js]
----
include::index.js[]
----

This allows us to seperate our JavaScript from our HTML as much as possible.
